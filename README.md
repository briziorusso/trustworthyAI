### gCastle

- A causal structure learning toolchain containing various functionalities related to causal learning and evaluation. A tech report describing the toolbox is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15155).
- The package offers a number of causal discovery algorithms, most of which are gradient-based, hence the name: **g**radient-based **Ca**usal **st**ructure **le**arning pipeline.

### Competition

- Information and baselines for causality-related competitions arranged by Noah's Ark Lab.


### Datasets

- Code for generating synthetic datasets and real-world datasets that we have open-sourced.

### Research 
 
- Research works related to causaility. We will continously add new methods here.
- Currently contains implementations of CausalVAE, GAE, and causal discovery with reinforcement learning.
